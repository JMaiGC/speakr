## Code Contributions

We welcome code contributions! However, due to the dual-licensing nature of Speakr (AGPLv3 and Commercial), we require all code contributors to sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

### Why We Require a CLA

Speakr is dual-licensed under:
1. **AGPLv3** - Open source license for the community
2. **Commercial License** - For organizations that cannot comply with AGPLv3

The CLA allows us to:
- Accept your valuable contributions
- Include them in both the open source and commercial versions
- Maintain flexibility to update licenses if needed in the future
- Protect the project from legal issues

**Important**: You retain copyright ownership of your contribution. The CLA simply grants us permission to use it.

### How to Sign the CLA

When you submit your first pull request, our CLA bot will automatically comment with instructions. You'll be asked to:

1. Review the [CLA document](CLA.md)
2. Sign by commenting on the PR: `I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA`
3. Our bot will verify and mark your signature

This is a one-time process. Once you've signed, all your future contributions to Speakr are covered.

### Contribution Process

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature`
3. **Make your changes** following our coding standards
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Commit** with clear, descriptive messages (see our commit policy below)
6. **Push** to your fork: `git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature`
7. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description of your changes
8. **Sign the CLA** when prompted by the bot
9. **Respond to feedback** from maintainers

### Coding Standards

- Follow the existing code style (Python PEP 8 for backend, Vue 3 conventions for frontend)
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages (see below)
- Include comments for complex logic
- Test your changes before submitting
- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix

### Commit Message Guidelines

```

Optional longer explanation if needed
```

**Good examples:**
- `Add inline transcript editing in speaker identification modal`
- `Fix undefined handle_openai_api_error function call in summary error handler`
- `Optimize recording view for mobile with compact layout`

**Avoid:**

- Provide clear description of what changed and why
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Ensure all tests pass (if applicable)
- Be responsive to review feedback
